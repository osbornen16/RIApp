## Authors:

* Nate Osborne
* Cheria Artis

## Purpose

Users can buy or sell artisan goods via Orders, made up of a product and the number of that product.

## Goals:

* Understand user stories, acceptance criteria, tasks, points, and sprints.
* Conceptually connect user stories to unit tests.
* Be able to plan a sprint and split features/epics into manageable tickets.
 

## Requirements:

* Create user stories (5-10)
* Create tickets/tasks (at least 12)
* Point the tickets using the Fibonacci rule (described below) or by T-shirt size (S, M, L, XL)
* Plan a sprint
* Divvy up tickets so everyone has roughly equal points
* Plan some stretch goals - what are some extra things you would like to get done beyond your MVP, if you have time?
* Begin work on the app
 

## Format:

### Turn in a GitHub repo with:

* The project code
* Any planning documents (Google docs, etc)
* Links to any external resources (Trello board, etc) in your  file
